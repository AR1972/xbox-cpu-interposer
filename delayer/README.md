# Delayered scans
This folder contains neatly aligned scans of a delayered 'N64freak' interposer.
They were delayered using sanding paper and scanned with a Canon 9000F flatbed scanner.

It is assumed that the 'trusty', 'N64freak' and 'Kekule' clone boards were recreated from similar scans of an original FRIENDTECH board.
